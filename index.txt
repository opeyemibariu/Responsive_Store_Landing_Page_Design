Design Choices

Layout: Flexbox for vertical stacking (header → section → footer); products use d-flex flex-wrap gap-3.

Responsiveness: Cards wrap on small screens; fixed width with flex-shrink-0; media queries for background testing.

Card Design: .card_body has fixed size, rounded corners, vertical flex layout with spaced content.

Header & Footer: Dark header with horizontal nav; footer full-width, centered text.

Bootstrap Use: Flex utilities (d-flex, flex-wrap, gap-3) for spacing; buttons use btn btn-primary; custom CSS avoids conflicts.
